# RandomJumpscares

A mod that adds the 1/10000 chance for Withered Foxy (and a 1/2500 chance for the Bad To The Bone riff) every second you are on the island, inspired by [ymy's original Terraria mod](<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3481943642>).

## Features

- A sick guitar riff
- A constant feeling of unease

## Configuration

You can configure:
- Jumpscare on/off
- Jumpscare odds
- Jumpscare volume

for both the Withered Foxy jumpscare and the Bad To The Bone riff.

After running the mod at least once, configuration can be found at: [steam directory]\PEAK\BepInEx\config\RandomJumpscares.cfg
(or in your mod manager's BepInEx directory)

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Extract the zip into your game directory, which should be at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK
3. Start the game once for first-time BepInEx setup
4. Place this mod's folder (containing RandomJumpscares.dll) into the BepInEx\plugins directory
5. Done!
