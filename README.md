# Random Jumpscares

A mod that adds the 1/10000 chance for Withered Foxy Jumpscare (and a 1/2500 chance for the Bad To The Bone riff) every second you are on the island, inspired by [ymy's original Terraria mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3481943642).

- A constant feeling of unease
